## About Me

I am a postdoc researcher at Stanford University. My research interests are:
1. <strong>AI for science (PDE modeling and inverse design)</strong>
2. <strong>Nanophotonics design and fabrication</strong>
3. <strong>Additive manufacturing</strong>

I completed my PhD at Stanford, advised by Prof. [Jonathan Fan](https://profiles.stanford.edu/jonathan-fan). Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree from MIT in EECS and Physics, advised by Prof. [Marin Soljačić](https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/marin-soljacic/). I interned at **FAIR Meta**, **Apple** and **Lawrence Livermore National Lab**. You can check out my CV [here](./assets/files/Chenkai_Mao_Resume_2026.pdf).
